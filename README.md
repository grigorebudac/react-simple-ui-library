# React Library using ESBuild and Typescript

The motivation behin this setup was to create a react library that compiles very fast, has an optimized bundle, supports different module systems (esm and cjs) and exposes all the definition types out of the box.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/grigorebudac/react-library-esbuild.git
cd react-library-esbuild
yarn install
```
